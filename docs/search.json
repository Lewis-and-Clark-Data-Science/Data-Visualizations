    "text": "A box plot is a graph that shows a numeric summary (y-axis) of either a categorical or numerical variable (x-axis). It gives information on the range of the data with either end of the plot.\nThe “box,” as shown below, represents three values: the 25th percentile, median (50th percentile), and the 75th percentile. Each horizontal bar corresponds to a number where that percentage of the data falls below. In other words, the horizontal bar closest to the x-axis represents where 25% of the data falls below, the bar in between the box is the median, or where 50% of the data fall below, and the furthest horizontal bar represents where 75% of the data falls below.\nThe vertical lines that emerge from the box are called whiskers. The whisker closest to the x-axis represents the minimum calculated by subtracting three times the interquartile range (75th percentile-25th percentile) from the value for the 25th percentile. The furthest whisker from the x-axis represents the maximum calculated by subtracting three times the interquartile range from the 75th percentile.\nHere is the framework of a box plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the penguin dataset, we can compare the flipper lengths (variable: flipper_length_mm) of the different species (variable: species) of penguins.\n\nggplot(data=penguins, mapping = aes(x=species, y=flipper_length_mm))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  labs(x=\"Species of Antarctic penguin\", y=\"Flipper length (mm)\", title = \"Species of Antarctic penguins have different flipper lengths\")\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Adelie penguins, there are outliers on either side of the whiskers. These are values fall short/exceed the whisker value calculation.\nNow, compare the flipper lengths (variable: flipper_length_mm) of the different sexes (variable: sex) of penguins\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

While they may look pretty, having too many colors can be distracting of your data’s big picture.\nLegends: To prevent the graph from being too busy, consider using a legend to explain your graph’s features.",
