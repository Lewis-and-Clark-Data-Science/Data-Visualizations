Each graph tutorial will guide you on what type of data goes on which axis.\nColors: Using colors can help guide your audience on what trend, if any, you want to emphasize. It is important to note that they should be used sparingly. While they may look pretty, having too many colors can be distracting of your data’s big picture.\nLegends: To prevent the graph from being too busy, consider using a legend to explain your graph’s features.",
