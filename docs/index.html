<p>The grammar of graphics package in R called ggplot2 is used to generate data visualizations. It breaks down the components of a plot, so you can adjust its aesthetics (size or intensity of plot points, colors, spatial arrangement of the elements) for a variety of graph types. Here, we will use ggplot2 to code:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Histograms</p></li>
<li><p>Box plots</p></li>
<li><p>Scatter plots</p></li>
<li><p>Bar plots</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-ggplot2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Installing ggplot2</h2>
<p>ggplot is a sub-package included in the tidyverse package. To install ggplot into your environment, run the code</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">"tidyverse"</span>)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<p>To load ggplot into your environment, run</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(tidyverse)</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<p>In this tutorial, don’t worry about installing tidyverse. However, you must install it on any of your personal projects.</p>

<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="elements-of-a-graph"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Elements of a graph</h2>
<p>There are key features in all graphs, including:</p>
<p><u>A title</u>: A good title should be the conclusion of your data analysis, or the relationship of your X and Y axes.</p>
<p><u>Axes</u>: The X and Y axis should have their respective types of data. Each graph tutorial will guide you on what type of data goes on which axis. Always include axes measurements!</p>
<p><u>Colors</u>: Using colors can help guide your audience on what trend, if any, you want to emphasize. It is important to note that they should be used sparingly. While they may look pretty, having too many colors can be distracting of your data’s big picture.</p>
<p><u>Legends</u>: To prevent the graph from being too busy, consider using a legend to explain your graph’s features.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-makes-a-graph-good" class="level2" data-number="4">
<h2 data-number="4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-makes-a-graph-good"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> What makes a graph good?</h2>
<p>Anyone should be able to look at a graph and understand your data without the context of your research. Take a step back from your code and ask yourself:</p>
<p><em>What is this graph telling me? What is the relationship between the X and Y variables?</em></p>
<p>The key to making a graph comprehensible is to make its story as clear as possible. Use the elements of your graph as tools to convey this story.</p>
</section>

<h2 data-number="5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-data"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Types of data</h2>
<p>Identifying the types of data you have will help you identify the type of graph you’ll need. There are two types of data with two subcategories for each:</p>
<p>Categorical: data arranged in groups</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Nominal: No priority or ranking (e.g., yes or no, favorite colors)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Ordinal: Structure within groups (e.g., small, medium, large; cold, warm, hot)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Numerical: all things numbers</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Continuous: Decimal/fractional integers</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Discrete: Whole integers</p>

<p><strong>Palmer penguins</strong>: This data set gives insight on the bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, sex, and year of data collection of various Antarctic penguins.</p>

<p>Take a look at each data set. Do you notice any trends? What variables interest you?</p>

<h2 data-number="7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ggplot-code-framework"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> ggplot Code Framework</h2>
<p>In order to use ggplot, there here is a skeletal framework:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(<span class="at">data=</span>dataset, <span class="at">mapping=</span><span class="fu">aes</span>(<span class="at">x=</span>xVariable, <span class="at">y=</span>yVariable))<span class="sc">+</span></span>

<p>Let’s break down each part of this graph:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, are calling on the ggplot function.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, we are asking R to look through our dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>The mapping=aes is used to change elements in your graph that are in the “Tips and Tricks” section of this site.</p></li>
<li><p>After that, we are explicitly telling R what variables we want on each axis.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, we are specifying which type of graph we want R to make.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we call on the labs function to rename our axes with our variable names, making sure to include units when necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we are ready to start coding! Let’s learn about some plots we can make with R.</p>
