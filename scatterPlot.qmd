## What is a scatter plot?

A scatter plot compares both a numerical values on the x and y axes. They can be used to show trends over time, or to show the correlation between two variables.

Here is the plot framework:

```{r}
#| label: generating frame plot
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
plot(x = 1,                 
     xlab = "Numeric variable", 
     ylab = "Numeric variable",
     xlim = c(0, 100), 
     ylim = c(0, 100),
     main = "Scatter plot framework",
     type = "n")
```

## Penguin Data

In the penguin data set, we can examine the relationship between bill depth and bill length.

*Note*: To generate a scatter plot, we call on the geom_point( ) function with ggplot.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data=penguins, mapping=aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm))+
  geom_point()
```

## Line of best fit

So we have these dots, but how do we know the relationship between x and y-variables?

In order to perform regression analysis, or how the x and y variables are related, we can use a linear model equation y=mx + b, where y is a function of the change in a given y-value times its respective x-value, plus the y-intercept, or where the y-value crosses the y=0 axis.

All this information can be found using this skeletal formula:

``` r
variable=lm(data = df, fomula = y-variable ~ x-variable)
summary(variable)
```

Here is the skeletal fomula applied to our scatter plot of the penguin bill depth vs. bill length. Below is the output: the summary statistics associated with this linear model.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
billDepthAndLengthModel=lm(data=penguins, formula=bill_depth_mm~bill_length_mm)

summary(billDepthAndLengthModel)
```
![](summaryStat.png)

While this output is intimidating, we only need two numbers for our purposes: the estimate intercept (b) and the slope (m), located right below that number.

Our line of regression can be represented in the equation y = -0.08502x + 20.88574

Here is the same scatter plot with the line of best fit:

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE

ggplot(data=penguins, mapping=aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

## Chick Data

Using the ChickWeight data set, that shows the the change in weight (variable: "weight") over time in days (variable: "Time") for chick 4.

First, we must filter the ChickWeight data to include only data from chick 4 by creating a new variable, "chick4".

```{r}
#| include: false
chick4<-ChickWeight %>%
  filter(Chick == 4)
```

```{webr-r}
#| exercise: ex3
___<-ChickWeight %>%
  filter(Chick == ___)
```

Now let's create a scatter plot of chick 4's weight over time. Don't worry about adding a title or axes labels. Make sure to add a line of regression!

```{webr-r}
#Type your code here
```

## Hint

R is case sensitive! The data set is named "ChickWeight" and the variables are "Time" and "weight". Which variable belongs on the x-axis? Which variable belongs on the y-axis.

## Answer

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(data=chick4, mapping=aes(x=Time, y=weight))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)
```
:::

Let's generate the line of best fit summary table for the chick4 data, using the model code from above.

```{r}
#| include: false
chick4Summary=lm(data = chick4, formula = weight~Time)
summary(chick4Summary)
```

```{webr-r}
#| exercise: ex4
chick4Summary=lm(data = ___ , formula = ___~___)
summary(chick4Summary)
```

Write the linear regression equation (y=mx+b) based on the summary model.

::: panel-tabset
## Code editor

```{webr-r}
#Type your code here
```

## Hint

Make sure you have the slope and y-intercept in their respective spots!

## Answer

```{webr-r}
#Type your code here
#| eval: false
y=6.0886x+32.8657
```
:::

This equation shows the relationship between the x-variable (time) and the y-variable (weight) for chick 4 from the ChickWeight data set.
