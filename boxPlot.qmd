## What is a box plot

A box plot is a graph that shows a ***numeric*** summary (y-axis) of either a ***categorical or numerical*** variable (x-axis). It gives information on the spread of data.

Here is the framework of a box plot, with a normally distributed data set.

![](normalPlot.png)

The "**box**," as shown below, represents three values: the 25th percentile (Q1), median (Q2), and the 75th percentile (Q3). Each horizontal bar corresponds to a number where that percentage of the data falls below, as shown. The box contains 50% of the data, known as the interquartile range. This value is calculated by subtracting Q1 from Q3.

The vertical lines that emerge from the box are called **whiskers**. The whisker closest to the x-axis represents the minimum calculated by subtracting 1.5 times the interquartile range from the value for Q1. The furthest whisker from the x-axis represents the maximum calculated by subtracting 1.5 times the interquartile range from Q3.

Here is the same data plotted as a scatter plot and a box plot. "Index" refers to the position on the list from which the random numbers were generated. In short, a boxplot gives a summary as to where your data lie, or how the data is spread.

```{r}
#| label: generating frame plot
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

data<-rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 10)  
df <- data.frame(value = data)

ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(1), y = value)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = factor(1)), width = 0.2, outlier.colour = "blue", outlier.shape = 1) + 
  geom_jitter(color = "blue", width = 0.1, height = 0.1, alpha = 0.4) + 
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot and Boxplot of Normally Distributed Data", x = "Index/Categorical data", y = "Numeric continuous") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

## Penguin Data

Using the penguin dataset, we can compare the flipper lengths (variable: flipper_length_mm) of the different species (variable: species) of penguins.

*Note:* We will call on the geom_boxplot( ) function when we code using ggplot

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE 

ggplot(data=penguins, mapping = aes(x=species, y=flipper_length_mm))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x="Species of Antarctic penguin", y="Flipper length (mm)", title = "Species of Antarctic penguins have different flipper lengths")
```

For the Adelie penguins, there are **outliers** on either side of the whiskers. These are values fall short/exceed the whisker value calculation.

This boxplot shows us that Gentoo penguins generally have a larger flipper length in millimeters than Chinstrap and Adelie penguins.

Now, compare the flipper lengths (variable: flipper_length_mm) of the different sexes (variable: sex) of penguins. Don't worry about adding a title or axes labels!

```{webr-r}
#| warning: False

ggplot(data=___, mapping = aes(x=___, y=___))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Hint

R is case sensitive! The data set is named "penguins" and the variables are "body_mass_g" and "sex". Which variable is categorical (x-variable) and which variable is numerical (y-variable)?

## Answer

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(data=penguins, mapping = aes(x=sex, y=body_mass_g))+
  geom_boxplot()
```
Which sex from the penguins data set tend to have a larger body mass in grams?

## Chick Data

Using the ChickWeight data, show the spread of the weight (variable: "weight") of the chicks on different diets (variable: "Diet"). 

::: panel-tabset
## Code editor

```{webr-r}
#Type your code here

```

## Hint

Make sure you have the correct x and y-variables! The x-variable is a categorical variable, and the y-variable is a numerical variable.

## Answer

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(data=ChickWeight, mapping = aes(x=Diet, y=weight))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

This chick data shows that there is not much of a difference in the spread of data across the four chick diets.
